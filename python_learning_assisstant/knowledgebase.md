Engine and Machine Warm-Up
Proper warm-up is essential to protect engine and hydraulic components, especially in cold weather.

Automatic Warm-Up
The machine has an automatic warm-up feature. If enabled, it will activate after starting if the hydraulic oil temperature is below the set threshold. Follow the prompts on the monitor.

Manual Warm-Up Procedure
Engine Warm-Up:

After starting, allow the engine to run at low idle for at least 5 minutes.

Recommended Times:

Above 0°C (32°F): Warm up for approx. 15 minutes.

Below 0°C (32°F): Warm up for approx. 30 minutes.

Below -18°C (0°F): Additional time may be required.

Hydraulic System Warm-Up:

After the initial engine warm-up, turn the engine speed dial to medium speed.

Run the engine for approximately 5 minutes.

Intermittently move the joystick from BUCKET DUMP to the HOLD position. Do not hold at full extension for more than 10 seconds. This helps warm the oil faster.

Turn the engine speed dial to maximum speed and repeat the joystick movement.

Cycle all controls (boom, stick, bucket, swing, travel) to circulate warm oil through all hydraulic components.

Important Notices:

Do not operate the machine until the "Warm-Up Mode Power Derate" message on the monitor disappears.

The hydraulic oil temperature should be above 25°C (77°F) before performing work. Abrupt operation with cold oil can damage hydraulic components.

The recommended operating temperature for hydraulic fluid is 55°C (131°F).

Basic Digging Technique
Follow these steps for efficient and safe digging with the Caterpillar 320/323 Excavator.

Positioning and Stability
Create a Stable Platform: Ensure the machine is on stable, level ground before digging.

Dig Over Idlers: For maximum stability, dig over the front idlers, not over the sides or the rear sprockets.

The Digging Cycle
Position the Stick: Start with the stick at approximately a 70-degree angle to the ground.

Position the Bucket: Position the bucket's cutting edge at about a 120-degree angle to the ground for maximum breakout force.

Start the Cut: Move the stick toward the cab while keeping the bucket parallel to the ground. Dig from the top down in layers.

Maintain Force: The most crowd force is generated when the stick is +/- 30 degrees from vertical. Decrease downward pressure as you move the stick toward the cab to maintain force.

Fill the Bucket: Maintain a bucket angle that allows a continuous flow of material. Try to have a full bucket by the time the stick is vertical.

Finish the Pass: Once the pass is complete, curl the bucket closed and raise the boom.

Swing and Dump: When the bucket is clear of the excavation, swing the upper structure. To dump, move the stick outward and open the bucket in a smooth motion.

Efficiency Tips
Minimize Movement: Only curl or dump the bucket as much as needed to hold or release material.

Truck Placement: For loading, a 45-degree truck placement is more efficient than 90 degrees. Position the truck to minimize swing distance.

Bench Loading: Load from a bench when possible for greater efficiency.

Smooth Operation: Concentrate on being smooth; speed will develop with practice.

Restricted Operations (What NOT to do)
Do not use swing force to compact soil, break ground, or for demolition.

Do not use the dropping force of the bucket as a hammer.

Do not operate cylinders at the very end of their stroke, as this causes excessive force.

Do not use the machine's travel force to assist in excavation.

Parking and Shutdown Procedure
Follow these steps to safely park, stop, and leave the machine.

Stopping the Machine
Location: Park on a hard, level surface. If you must park on a grade, chock the tracks securely.

Stop Travel: Release the travel levers/pedals to stop the machine. They will return to the center position and the brakes will apply.

Lower Work Tool: Lower the work tool (bucket) to the ground. Apply slight downward pressure.

Hydraulic Lockout: Move the hydraulic lockout control lever to the LOCKED position.

Stopping the Engine
Cool Down Period: After operating under load, run the engine at low idle for 5 minutes. This allows hot areas of the engine to cool gradually and prevents damage to components like the turbocharger.

Turn Off: Turn the engine start switch to the OFF position.

Leaving the Machine
Dismount Safely: Use steps and handholds, maintaining three-point contact. Face the machine when dismounting.

Inspect: Check the engine compartment for debris to avoid a fire hazard.

Battery Disconnect: Turn the battery disconnect switch to the OFF position. If leaving the machine for a month or more, remove the disconnect switch key.
